/*
one of the types of algorithmic time complexity is binary search, in binary search we find the item in the middle of the array and we compare it to the input if the array is sorted (for example a yellow pages) the array will give us a hint about the position of the item (it will be either bigger or smaller than the middle point) then the array will be sliced according to the position of the item with respect to the middle point. the sliced array will be send again along with the item to the function to do the search on. this way we itterate less. we are supposed to find the item in 7-8 trials.
